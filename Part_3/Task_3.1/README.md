# Task 3.1 A deployment pipeline to Heroku

## Task
Let’s create our first deployment pipeline!
For this exercise you can select which ever web application you already have containerized.
If you don’t have any web applications available you can use any one from this course and modify it. (Such as the course material itself)
Use GitHub, Github Actions, and Heroku to deploy a container to heroku. You can also use other CI/CD tools instead of GitHub Actions.
Submit a link to the repository with the config.

## Application used
The application used here is the course material docker-hy.github.io.

## What did I do?
1. Making a local repo of the course material docker-hy.github.io.
2. Making a repository of its own to GitHub of the previous.
3.
